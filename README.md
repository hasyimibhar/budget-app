# Budget App

Budget App is an exercise of implementing the backend of a budgeting app using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It's basically a clone of [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

DDD is an approach to software development where the domain (business rules and logic) is separated from the application (e.g. web app) and the infrastructure (e.g. database). DDD is useful for building software with complex business rules.
